# What is MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a server-side protocol and framework designed to connect AI models, LLM agents, or applications to external tools and content sources. It allows these agents to perform common workflow actionsâ€”such as searching databases, retrieving documentation, or converting filesâ€”by exposing a standard set of API endpoints.

## Key Features

- **Standardization**: MCP defines a uniform API that tools and data sources can implement, enabling interoperability between models and services[5].
- **Tool Orchestration**: Models can dynamically query tools (e.g., file converters, web search, knowledge bases) via the MCP server, which acts as a bridge between the AI and backend resources[2][3].
- **Document Conversion**: MCP servers often provide file conversion capabilities, such as turning PDFs, Office documents, images, or websites into Markdown for easy integration into context windows[1][6][7].
- **Agentic Workflows**: Facilitates automated workflows where LLMs or bots can reason, fetch data, and perform multi-step processes by calling MCP-exposed tools[2].
- **RESTful APIs**: Most MCP servers expose a REST API interface, allowing HTTP-based requests and responses for integration into diverse platforms[6].

## Typical Use Cases

- **AI Documentation Retrieval**: LLMs access technical documentation by converting it to Markdown via an MCP server[3][7].
- **Automated File Conversion**: Workflow automation for turning various file types (DOCX, PDF, audio, images) into Markdown for downstream AI consumption[1][6].
- **Enhanced Context for LLMs**: Dynamically pull relevant data packs or knowledge base snippets into



## MCP client
- Invoke tools
- Queries for Resources
- Interpoated Prompts

### MCP clients has 3 main componets:
  1. **Tools** [Model-control] (Functions invoked by the model eg- Retrieve/Search)
  2. **Resources** [Application-control] (Data exposed to the application eg- files, DB records, API Responses)
  3. **Prompts** [User-control] (Pre-defined templates for AI interations)

## MCP Server
- Exposes Tools
- Exposes Resources
- Exposes Prompts

## âœ… MCP Runtimes

The **Management Control Protocol (MCP)** supports two main runtime modes for the MCP server:

---

### ðŸ”¹ 1. SSE (Server-Sent Events)

SSE allows the MCP server to run either **locally** or as a **remotely hosted** service. It uses **HTTP-based, one-way communication** where the server pushes events to the client.

#### ðŸ“Œ Use SSE when:
- You need **local integrations**.Ì¦
- Working with **command-line tools and scripts**.
- Performing **development and testing**.
- Operating in **single-client scenarios**.
- Handling **security-sensitive operations** (isolated from network risks).

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. STDIO (Standard Input/Output)

The **STDIO transport mechanism** enables the MCP server to communicate via **standard input and output streams**. It is primarily intended for **local hosting** scenarios.

#### ðŸ“Œ Use STDIO when:
- Building **command-line tools**.
- Implementing **local-only integrations**.
- Requiring **simple inter-process communication**.
- Working with **shell scripts or automation tools**.

### ðŸŽ¯ Summary

| Runtime Mode | Hosting Style        | Ideal Use Case                                     |
|--------------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **SSE**      | Local / Remote       | Web-based tools, secure remote communication       |
| **STDIO**    | Local Only           | Scripts, local tools, development, testing         |
